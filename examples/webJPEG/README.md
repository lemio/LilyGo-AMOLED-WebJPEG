# webJPEG

Streams a browser tab, window, or camera to a LilyGo T-Display AMOLED board over WiFi.
The browser captures video with `getDisplayMedia`/`getUserMedia`, draws each frame to a
`<canvas>`, encodes it as a JPEG, and sends it over a plain `WebSocket`. The ESP32
decodes each JPEG and pushes it straight to the display.

This is the sibling of [webH264](../webH264) - see the root [README](../../README.md)
for how the two compare and which one to pick. Both share the same streaming page
([stream.html](../stream.html)) and the same on-device WiFi setup flow.

## Flashing

See the root [README](../../README.md#flashing) for the browser flasher (no PlatformIO
install needed) and the PlatformIO command-line steps. This example's PlatformIO
environment name is `webJPEG`.

## Board support

This example calls the display library's automatic board-detection `amoled.begin()`
(see `beginAutomatic()`/`begin()` in
[LilyGo_AMOLED.cpp](../../src/LilyGo_AMOLED.cpp)), which probes I2C addresses at boot to
tell the panels apart - no compile-time board selection needed. In principle the same
one firmware build works on:

| Board | Panel | Native resolution |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------ |
| T-Display AMOLED Lite 1.47" | SH8501 | 194x368 |
| T-Display AMOLED 1.91" (QSPI) | RM67162 | 240x536 |
| T-Display AMOLED 1.91" (SPI) | RM67162 | 240x536 |
| T-Display AMOLED 2.41" / T4-S3 | RM690B0 | 600x450 |

**Caveat:** this fork's changes (the WebSocket/JPEG rendering path, the `/boardinfo`
endpoint, this README) were developed against the 1.47" board; the 1.91" panel has
since been confirmed working on real hardware too (see "Measured performance" below).
The 2.41"/T4-S3 row is what the detection code *should* produce, read from the library
source, not something verified on that physical hardware here. If you hit a
board-specific problem (wrong colors, offset image, wrong dimensions), please open an
issue with your board model and a serial log from boot.

## Measured performance

Real numbers from the per-frame Serial log, same 1.91" board and content (screen
share) as the H.264 comparison in the root README, measured after the rendering-path
fix described in "Technical notes" below.

| Board | Resolution | Avg decode | Avg render | Avg push | Rendered-frame rate |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| 1.91" | 536x240 | 1.1ms | 156.6ms | 11.4ms | ~5.9fps |

(67 consecutive rendered frames.)

For comparison, before the fix this same board measured 183ms average render (pushing
each decoded 16x16 MCU block to the display individually, 510 `pushColors()` calls per
frame) and ~5.4fps. Buffering the whole frame into a sprite before a single bulk push
removed the visible top-to-bottom "unrolling" render effect, and cut the frame-drop
rate roughly in half (see below) - but barely moved the frame rate itself (~5.4fps to
~5.9fps). That's the more interesting result: it means the 183ms was never really the
cost of 510 small *display-bus* transactions, since replacing them with 510 in-RAM
`spr.pushImage()` calls didn't recover that time either. The cost is dominated by
making 510 separate calls at all - each with its own bounds-checking and byte-swap
logic - not by where those calls send their data. A further speedup would mean fewer,
larger copies per frame (e.g. decoding straight into the sprite's memory layout),
not just picking a cheaper destination for the same number of calls.

**The device has no flow control**, unlike webH264 (see that example's "Flow control"
section). It just renders what it can and silently drops the rest: in the measurement
above, 31 fully-received frames were dropped ("Mutex busy - frame dropped") against 67
that got rendered - about 32% of everything the browser successfully encoded and sent
was thrown away without ever reaching the screen, because the device was still busy
rendering the previous frame. Better than the ~70% drop rate measured before the fix
(rendering finishes sooner, so fewer incoming frames arrive mid-render), but still
wasted browser-side encode CPU and network bandwidth. If you're seeing a lot of these
in your own serial log, try lowering **Frame Rate** in stream.html closer to what
"Rendered-frame rate" in the table above suggests your board can actually keep up with.

**Stability (fixed, pending re-verification on hardware):** sustained streaming used to
eventually hit a burst of consecutive `JPEG decode failed!` errors, followed by a
`Malloc failed for 0 bytes!` and a `task_wdt` abort/reboot on the `async_tcp` task. The
suspected cause was internal-heap fragmentation: `webJPEG.cpp` used to `malloc()` a
freshly-sized frame buffer for every incoming WebSocket frame and `free()` it right
after, and no two frames compress to the same byte count, so hours of that made the
heap a moving target until an allocation eventually failed. The fix - already applied,
matching webH264's `wsAssemblyBuf` approach - allocates one fixed-size buffer per
stream (`MAX_FRAME_SIZE`, 512KB) from PSRAM once at boot and reuses it for every frame;
oversized frames are dropped instead of allocated for. Not yet re-verified against a
real long-running crash reproduction - if you still hit a reboot after updating,
please open an issue with a serial log from just before it happens.

## Using it

1. Flash the firmware and open the Serial Monitor - it prints the assigned IP address,
   and the display itself shows a connection spinner, then the IP address and mDNS
   hostname once WiFi connects (see the root README's "Setup flow" section - this is
   identical to webH264's).
2. Visit `http://<that address>` (or `http://esp-webjpeg.local`, unless you set a
   different mDNS hostname). The board doesn't serve the streaming page itself - it
   302-redirects you to the HTTPS copy of [stream.html](../stream.html) hosted on GitHub
   Pages, pre-filling the `espAddress` field with the board's address and detecting that
   this is a webJPEG board. See the root README's "Why the redirect" section for why,
   and the one manual step it requires (allowing "insecure content" once per browser).
3. The Display Size dropdown auto-detects your board's resolution - override it
   manually if detection fails. Pick a source (webcam or screen share), then Start
   Streaming and grant the permission prompt. Captured video is stretched to fill the
   display exactly, so match its aspect ratio to avoid distortion.

## Options in stream.html

Once [stream.html](../stream.html) detects a webJPEG board (or you force "Mode: Force
WebJPEG"), it shows:

- **Rotation** (shared with webH264) - 0/90/180/270deg. Rotates the captured content in
  the browser before sending; the board always receives a plain landscape image
  regardless of this setting, so this is how to drive a physically sideways-mounted
  display. See the root README for how it works.
- **Display Size** - auto-filled from `/boardinfo`; override manually if it's wrong or
  the board is unreachable at page load.
- **Source** - webcam or screen share.
- **Frame Rate** - how often the browser captures and sends a frame.
- **JPEG Quality** - lower for less bandwidth/lag, higher for image quality.
- **Monochrome Mode** - converts frames to grayscale before encoding; smaller frames,
  faster to send, at the cost of colour. Sent over a separate `/ws-mono` WebSocket
  endpoint from colour mode's `/ws`.

`stream.html` also accepts URL query parameters for bookmarking a specific setup:
`espAddress`, `rotation` (`0`/`90`/`180`/`270`), `displaySize` (`WxH` or a predefined
size), `customWidth`/`customHeight` (when `displaySize=custom`), `sourceType`
(`camera`/`screen`), `frameRate` (1-30), `quality` (0.1-1.0), `monoMode` (`true`/`false`).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Start Streaming" does nothing / permission prompt never appears:** you're probably
  on the board's own `http://` page rather than the HTTPS redirect target - check the
  address bar says `https://lemio.github.io/...`. If it already does, see the root
  README's "Why the redirect" for the one-time insecure-content exception the WebSocket
  needs.
- **Image looks wrong (bands, wrong colors, partial screen):** the display size selected
  in the browser must match your physical board. Auto-detection should get this right;
  if it didn't (e.g. `/boardinfo` unreachable), set it manually from the table above.
- **Choppy / laggy stream:** lower the frame rate or JPEG quality slider - see
  "Measured performance" above for roughly what frame rate your board can sustain.
  A high drop count ("Mutex busy - frame dropped" in the serial log) means the browser
  is sending faster than the device can render; lowering Frame Rate reduces wasted
  encode/network work even though the *rendered* rate is capped by the device either way.
- **Reboots after streaming for a while, with `JPEG decode failed!` spam and a
  `task_wdt`/`async_tcp` abort in the serial log beforehand:** should be fixed - see
  "Stability" under "Measured performance" above. If you still see it after updating,
  please open an issue with a serial log from just before the reboot.

## Technical notes

- Every rendered frame logs a per-stage timing breakdown to Serial: `Decode` (JPEG
  decode itself, typically ~1-3ms - cheap), `Setup` (centering/offset math), `Render`
  (decoding MCU blocks into the sprite buffer), `Push` (one bulk `pushColors()` call
  for the whole frame), and `Total`.
- Every frame renders into a `TFT_eSprite` buffer and reaches the display in a single
  bulk `pushColors()` call, whether or not the incoming JPEG matches the display's
  resolution exactly - matching webH264's approach. This used to differ: when a frame
  matched the display size exactly (`Direct: YES` in the log), each decoded 16x16 MCU
  block was pushed to the display individually instead, which was both the dominant
  per-frame cost and produced a visible top-to-bottom "unrolling" render effect. See
  "Measured performance" above for the pre-fix numbers this replaced.
- Board IDs returned by `amoled.getBoardID()` (see
  [LilyGo_AMOLED.h](../../src/LilyGo_AMOLED.h)):
  `LILYGO_AMOLED_147=1`, `LILYGO_AMOLED_191=2`, `LILYGO_AMOLED_241=3`,
  `LILYGO_AMOLED_191_SPI=4`.
- Color format is RGB565. `webJPEG.cpp` only byte-swaps when pushing pixels straight to
  the display (`amoled.pushColors`) - the `TFT_eSprite` buffer path swaps internally via
  `setSwapBytes(true)`, so swapping there too would double-flip the colors.
- When the incoming JPEG doesn't exactly match the display's resolution, frames are
  rendered into a sprite buffer and centered instead of pushed directly - slower, but
  avoids corrupting partial-tile edges.
- `/boardinfo` (JSON: `variant`, `name`, `width`, `height`, `boardId`) is what
  `stream.html` uses to tell this firmware apart from webH264's and to auto-fill the
  display size. Served with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` since the calling page is
  cross-origin (GitHub Pages, not the device) - safe here since every endpoint is
  read-only board/status info or the streaming WebSocket, nothing sensitive.
- Incoming WebSocket frames are reassembled into a fixed-size PSRAM buffer
  (`MAX_FRAME_SIZE`, 512KB) allocated once at boot, not `malloc()`/`free()`'d per
  frame - see the "Stability" note under "Measured performance" above for why.
  Frames larger than that are dropped rather than risking an allocation.
